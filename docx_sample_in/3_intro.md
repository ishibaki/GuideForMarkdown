## Introduction

### Left-right asymmetry in animals

Many animals show the directional LR asymmetry in their body structures and functions. Mechanisms of LR asymmetric development have been the one of central question in Developmental Biology [@Levin2005].
The molecular mechanisms of the LR asymmetric development have been well studied, although mostly in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Kimelman2012; @Riechmann2001].
For example, in some vertebrates, the LR symmetry is first broken by an LR directional flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which is induced by ciliary rotation in the node or its equivalent tissue in early embryos [@Yoshiba2014].
In contrast, in invertebrates the mechanisms of LR-asymmetry formation remain unclear, although a few excellent studies have unveiled basic concepts behind the directional LR asymmetry formation in nematodes, snails, and *Drosophila* [@Blum2018; @Kuroda2009;@Okumura2008; @Speder2007].
Some invertebrate species develop LR asymmetric body structures using mechanisms arising from the intrinsic chirality of blastomeres or cells in tissues, which is distinct from the mechanism used in vertebrates, indicating that the processes for directional LR symmetric development diverged in evolution [@Blum2018; @Inaki2018; @Okumura2008].

Several organs in *Drosophila* also show a directional LR asymmetric morphology [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006; @Ligoxygakis2001; @Pascual2004; @Speder2006].
Among these organs, the embryonic gut is the first to exhibit an LR asymmetric shape during development [@Campos-Ortega2015; @Hayashi2001; @Ligoxygakis2001].
The embryonic hindgut shows the simple morphology exhibiting the stereotypic LR asymmetry, in which a monolayer epithelial tube bends like a hook at its most anterior part (Fig. 1A).
At an early stage of embryonic development (stage 12), the hindgut is LR symmetric and bends toward the ventral side of the embryo (Fig. 1A).
At the next stage of development (stage 12-13), the hindgut rotates anticlockwise 90Â°, which causes the hindgut to curve rightward and to be LR asymmetric (Fig. 1A) [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006].
Neither cell division nor apoptosis is involved in this rotation [@Campos-Ortega2015].
Moreover, the embryonic hindgut epithelial tube, but not the surrounding visceral muscles, is sufficient for this rotation [@Hozumi2006; @Nakamura2013].
Thus, LR asymmetric cell deformation of the hindgut epithelial cells themselves may contribute to the hindgut rotation.

### Cell chirality

In agreement with this idea, we previously reported that the epithelial cells of the embryonic hindgut exhibit an LR-asymmetric shape in their apical surface before hindgut rotation [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a; @Inaki2018; @Taniguchi2011].
