abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Polarized epithelial morphogenesis is an essential process in animal development. While this process is mostly attributed to directional cell intercalation, it can also be induced by other mechanisms. Using live-imaging analysis and a three-dimensional vertex model, we identified ‘cell sliding,' a novel mechanism driving epithelial morphogenesis, in which cells directionally change their position relative to their subjacent (posterior) neighbors by sliding in one direction. In Drosophila embryonic hindgut, an initial left-right (LR) asymmetry of the cell shape (cell chirality in three dimensions), which occurs intrinsically before tissue deformation, is converted through LR asymmetric cell sliding into a directional axial twisting of the epithelial tube. In a Drosophila inversion mutant showing inverted cell chirality and hindgut rotation, cell sliding occurs in the opposite direction to that in wild-type. Unlike directional cell intercalation, cell sliding does not require junctional remodeling. Cell sliding may also be involved in other cases of LR-polarized epithelial morphogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Symmetry is appealing, be it in architecture, art or facial expression, where symmetry is a key feature to finding someone attractive or not. Yet, asymmetries are widespread in nature, not as an erroneous deviation from the norm but as a way to adapt to the prevailing environmental conditions at a time. Asymmetries in many cases are actively selected for: they might well have increased the evolutionary fitness of a species. Even many single-celled organisms are built asymmetrically, such as the pear-shaped ciliate Paramecium, which may depend on its asymmetry to navigate towards the oxygen-richer surface of turbid waters, at least based on modeling. Everybody knows the lobster with its asymmetric pair of claws, the large crusher usually on the left and the smaller cutter on the right. Snail shells coil asymmetrically, as do the organs they house. Organ asymmetries are found throughout the animal kingdom, referring to asymmetric positioning, asymmetric morphology or both, with the vertebrate heart being an example for the latter. Functional asymmetries, such as that of the human brain with its localization of the language center in one hemisphere, add to the complexity of organ asymmetries and presumably played a decisive role for sociocultural evolution. The evolutionary origin of organ asymmetries may have been a longer than body length gut, which allows efficient retrieval of nutrients, and the need to stow a long gut in the body cavity in an orderly manner that ensures optimal functioning. Vertebrate organ asymmetries (situs solitus) are quite sophisticated: in humans, the apex of the asymmetrically built heart points to the left; the lung in turn, due to space restrictions, has fewer lobes on the left than on the right side (two versus three in humans), stomach and spleen are found on the left, the liver on the right, and small and large intestine coil in a chiral manner (Figure 1A). In very rare cases (1:10,000), the organ situs is inverted (situs inversus), while heterotaxia refers to another rare situation (about 1:1,000), in which subsets of organs show normal or aberrant positioning or morphology (Figure 1B). Individuals with situs solitus or situs inversus are healthy, whereas heterotaxia presents severe congenital malformations. Many human syndromes are known in which patients suffer from laterality defects, such as Katagener syndrome, in which the organ situs is inverted in one half of patients and males are sterile. Snail shells and vertebrate organs are examples of biased asymmetries with on average only one inversion in every 10,000 cases. Other asymmetries such as the coiling of the tails of piglets occur randomly with a 50:50 distribution. This primer exclusively deals with organ asymmetries in the animal kingdom, specifically with the mechanisms that ensure the development of biased asymmetries during embryogenesis.

abstract = {Most macromolecules found in cells are chiral, meaning that they cannot be superimposed onto their mirror image. However, cells themselves can also be chiral, a subject that has received little attention until very recently. In our studies on the mechanisms of left-right (LR) asymmetric development in Drosophila, we discovered that cells can have an intrinsic chirality to their structure, and that this "cell chirality" is generally responsible for the LR asymmetric development of certain organs in this species. The actin cytoskeleton plays important roles in the formation of cell chirality. In addition, Myosin31DF (Myo31DF), which encodes Drosophila Myosin ID, was identified as a molecular switch for cell chirality. In other invertebrate species, including snails and Caenorhabditis elegans, chirality of the blastomeres, another type of cell chirality, determines the LR asymmetry of structures in the body. Thus, chirality at the cellular level may broadly contribute to LR asymmetric development in various invertebrate species. Recently, cell chirality was also reported for various vertebrate cultured cells, and studies suggested that cell chirality is evolutionarily conserved, including the essential role of the actin cytoskeleton. Although the biological roles of cell chirality in vertebrates remain unknown, it may control LR asymmetric development or other morphogenetic events. The investigation of cell chirality has just begun, and this new field should provide valuable new insights in biology and medicine.},

abstract = {Anatomical and functional asymmetries are widespread in the animal kingdom [1, 2]. In vertebrates, many visceral organs are asymmetrically placed [3]. In snails, shells and inner organs coil asymmetrically, and in Drosophila, genitalia and hindgut undergo a chiral rotation during development. The evolutionary origin of these asymmetries remains an open question [1]. Nodal signaling is widely used [4], and many, but not all, vertebrates use cilia for symmetry breaking [5]. In Drosophila, which lacks both cilia and Nodal, the unconventional myosin ID (myo1d) gene controls dextral rotation of chiral organs [6, 7]. Here, we studied the role of myo1d in left-right (LR) axis formation in Xenopus. Morpholino oligomer-mediated myo1d downregulation affected organ placement in {\textgreater}50{\%} of morphant tadpoles. Induction of the left-asymmetric Nodal cascade was aberrant in {\textgreater}70{\%} of cases. Expression of the flow-target gene dand5 was compromised, as was flow itself, due to shorter, fewer, and non-polarized cilia at the LR organizer. Additional phenotypes pinpointed Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling and suggested that myo1d, like in Drosophila [8], acted in the context of the planar cell polarity pathway. Indeed, convergent extension of gastrula explant cultures was inhibited in myo1d morphants, and the ATF2 reporter gene for non-canonical Wnt signaling was downregulated. Finally, genetic interference experiments demonstrated a functional interaction between the core planar cell polarity signaling gene vangl2 and myo1d in LR axis formation. Thus, our data identified myo1d as a common denominator of arthropod and chordate asymmetry, in agreement with a monophyletic origin of animal asymmetry. Tingler et al. show that myosin 1D is required for laterality in the frog Xenopus, namely for left-asymmetric gene expression and leftward flow. Myosin 1D acts through the planar cell polarity pathway, a key feature of asymmetric gonad and gut morphogenesis in Drosophila, suggesting a common evolutionary origin of arthropod and chordate laterality.},

A cilia-driven, directional fluid flow is important for symmetry breaking in numerous vertebrates, including zebrafish. Alternatively, LR asymmetry can be established independently of cilia, notably through the intrinsic chirality of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that Myosin1D (Myo1D), a previously identified regulator of Drosophila LR asymmetry, is essential for the formation and function of the zebrafish LR organizer (LRO), Kupffer's vesicle (KV). Myo1D controls the orientation of LRO cilia and interacts functionally with the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway component VanGogh-like2 (Vangl2), to shape a productive LRO flow. Our findings identify Myo1D as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of animal LR asymmetry, and show that functional interactions between Myo1D and PCP are central to the establishment of animal LR asymmetry.},

abstract = {Inhibitors of DNA binding and cell differentiation (Id) proteins are members of the large family of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors, but they lack any DNA-binding motif. During development, the Id proteins play a key role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and cell differentiation by modulating different cell-cycle regulators both by direct and indirect mechanisms. Several Id-protein interacting partners have been identified thus far, which belong to structurally and functionally unrelated families, including, among others, the class I and II bHLH transcription factors, the retinoblastoma protein and related pocket proteins, the paired-box transcription factors, and the S5a subunit of the 26 S proteasome. Although the HLH domain of the Id proteins is involved in most of their protein-protein interaction events, additional motifs located in their N-terminal and C-terminal regions are required for the recognition of diverse protein partners. The ability of the Id proteins to interact with structurally different proteins is likely to arise from their conformational flexibility: indeed, these proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions that, in the case of the HLH region, undergo folding upon self- or heteroassociation. Besides their crucial role for cell-fate determination and cell-cycle progression during development, other important cellular events have been related to the Id-protein expression in a number of pathologies. Dysregulated Id-protein expression has been associated with tumor growth, vascularization, invasiveness, metastasis, chemoresistance and stemness, as well as with various developmental defects and diseases. Herein we provide an overview on the structural properties, mode of action, biological function and therapeutic potential of these regulatory proteins.},

abstract = {Vertebrates exhibit striking left–right (L–R) asymmetries in the structure and position of the internal organs. Symmetry is broken by motile cilia-generated asymmetric fluid flow, resulting in a signaling cascade – the Nodal–Pitx2 pathway – being robustly established within mesodermal tissue on the left side only. This pathway impinges upon various organ primordia to instruct their side-specific development. Recently, progress has been made in understanding both the breaking of embryonic L–R symmetry and how the Nodal–Pitx2 pathway controls lateralized cell differentiation, migration, and other aspects of cell behavior, as well as tissue-level mechanisms, that drive asymmetries in organ formation. Proper execution of asymmetric organogenesis is critical to health, making furthering our understanding of L–R development an important concern. Gut looping morphogenesis depends on Nodal–Pitx2 pathway-induced changes to the cellular architecture of the dorsal mesentery coupled with physical forces imparted on the gut by the dorsal mesentery. In zebrafish, gut asymmetries are driven by asymmetric migration of the lateral plate mesoderm, which pushes the gut tube away from the midline. Early cardiac asymmetries depend on Nodal signaling-induced asymmetries in cardiac progenitor cell migration. Cardiac looping asymmetry is driven by forces intrinsic to the heart but made robust by external Nodal pathway cues. Asymmetric migration of the parapineal in the zebrafish brain is achieved by an integration of FGF and Nodal signals, which drive migration and bias the direction, respectively.},

This review briefly considers advances in developmental biological studies on bHLHs/HLHs.

We reveal that filopodia of neuronal growth cones exhibit 3D left-helical motion with retraction and right-screw rotation.

abstract = {Neural tube closure is an important and necessary process during the development of the central nervous system. The formation of the neural tube structure from a flat sheet of neural epithelium requires several cell morphogenetic events and tissue dynamics to account for the mechanics of tissue deformation. Cell elongation changes cuboidal cells into columnar cells, and apical constriction then causes them to adopt apically narrow, wedge-like shapes. In addition, the neural plate in Xenopus is stratified, and the non-neural cells in the deep layer (deep cells) pull the overlying superficial cells, eventually bringing the two layers of cells to the midline. Thus, neural tube closure appears to be a complex event in which these three physical events are considered to play key mechanical roles. To test whether these three physical events are mechanically sufficient to drive neural tube formation, we employed a three-dimensional vertex model and used it to simulate the process of neural tube closure. The results suggest that apical constriction cued the bending of the neural plate by pursing the circumference of the apical surface of the neural cells. Neural cell elongation in concert with apical constriction further narrowed the apical surface of the cells and drove the rapid folding of the neural plate, but was insufficient for complete neural tube closure. Migration of the deep cells provided the additional tissue deformation necessary for closure. To validate the model, apical constriction and cell elongation were inhibited in Xenopus laevis embryos. The resulting cell and tissue shapes resembled the corresponding simulation results.},

abstract = {An item is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Most biological molecules are chiral. The homochirality of amino acids ensures that proteins are chiral, which is essential for their functions. Chirality also occurs at the whole-cell level, which was first studied mostly in ciliates, single-celled protozoans. Ciliates show chirality in their cortical structures, which is not determined by genetics, but by  cortical inheritance. These studies suggested that molecular chirality directs whole-cell chirality. Intriguingly, chirality in cellular structures and functions is also found in metazoans. In Drosophila, intrinsic cell chirality is observed in various left-right (LR) asymmetric tissues, and appears to be responsible for their LR asymmetric morphogenesis. In other invertebrates, such as snails and Caenorhabditis elegans, blastomere chirality is responsible for subsequent LR asymmetric development. Various cultured cells of vertebrates also show intrinsic chirality in their cellular behaviours and intracellular structural dynamics. Thus, cell chirality may be a general property of eukaryotic cells. In Drosophila, cell chirality drives the LR asymmetric development of individual organs, without establishing the LR axis of the whole embryo. Considering that organ-intrinsic LR asymmetry is also reported in vertebrates, this mechanism may contribute to LR asymmetric development across phyla. This article is part of the themed issue  Provocative questions in left-right asymmetry.},

However, the physiological role of these repeats and the consequences of more moderate repeat variation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Q-rich domains are highly enriched in eukaryotic transcription factors where they act as functional modulators. Incremental changes in the number of repeats in the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 (Cyc8) result in systematic, repeat-length-dependent variation in expression of target genes that result in direct phenotypic changes. The function of Ssn6 increases with its repeat number until a certain threshold where further expansion leads to aggregation. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the Ssn6 repeats affect its solubility and interactions with Tup1 and other regulators. Thus, Q-rich repeats are dynamic functional domains that modulate a regulator's innate function, with the inherent risk of pathogenic repeat expansions.},

However, pQ tracts {\textgreater} 40 residues are pathologically prone to amyloidogenic self-assembly. Here, we assess the extent and consequences of variation in the pQ-encoding opa repeats of Notch in Drosophila melanogaster. We use Sanger sequencing to genotype opa sequences (5'-CAX repeats), which have resisted assembly using short sequence reads. While most sampled lines carry the major allele opa31 encoding Q13HQ17 or the opa32 allele encoding Q13HQ18, many lines carry rare alleles encoding pQ tracts {\textgreater} 32 residues: opa33a (Q14HQ18), opa33b (Q15HQ17), opa34 (Q16HQ17), opa35a1/opa35a2 (Q13HQ21), opa36 (Q13HQ22), and opa37 (Q13HQ23). Only one rare allele encodes a tract {\textless} 31 residues: opa23 (Q13-Q10). This opa23 allele shortens the pQ tract while simultaneously eliminating the interrupting histidine. We introgressed these opa variant alleles into common backgrounds, and measured the frequency of Notch-type phenotypes. Homozygotes for the short and long opa alleles have defects in embryonic survival and sensory bristle organ patterning, and sometimes show wing notching. Consistent with functional differences between Notch opa variants, we find that a scute inversion carrying the rare opa33b allele suppresses the bristle patterning defect caused by achaete/scute insufficiency, while an equivalent scute inversion carrying opa31 manifests the patterning defect. Our results demonstrate the existence of potent pQ variants of Notch, and the need for long read genotyping of key repeat variables underlying gene regulatory networks.},

Within the Drosophila retina, {\{}D/V{\}} axis formation is essential to ensure that each unit eye first adopts the proper chiral form and then rotates precisely 90{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} in the correct direction. These two steps are important because the photoreceptor array must be correctly aligned with the neurons of the optic lobe. Defects in chirality and/or ommatidial rotation will lead to disorganization of the photoreceptor array, misalignment of retinal and optic lobe neurons, and loss of visual acuity. Loss of the helix-loop-helix protein Extramacrochaetae {\{}(Emc){\}} leads to defects in both ommatidial chirality and rotation. Here, we describe a new role for emc in eye development in patterning the {\{}D/V{\}} axis. We show that the juxtaposition of dorsal and ventral fated tissue in the eye leads to an enrichment of emc expression at the {\{}D/V{\}} midline. emc expression at the midline can be eliminated when {\{}D/V{\}} patterning is disrupted and can be induced in situations in which ectopic boundaries are artificially generated.

Drosophila melanogaster has three class I myosin genes, Myosin 31DF (Myo31DF), Myosin 61F (Myo61F), and Myosin 95E (Myo95E). Myo31DF, Myo61F, and Myo95E belong to the Myosin ID, Myosin IC, and Myosin IB families, respectively. Previous loss-of-function analyses of Myo31DF and Myo61F revealed important roles in left-right (LR) asymmetric development and enterocyte maintenance, respectively. However, it was difficult to elucidate their roles in vivo, because of potential redundant activities. Here we generated class I myosin double and triple mutants to address this issue. We found that the triple mutant was viable and fertile, indicating that all three class I myosins were dispensable for survival. A loss-of-function analysis revealed further that Myo31DF and Myo61F, but not Myo95E, had redundant functions in promoting the dextral LR asymmetric development of the male genitalia. Myo61F overexpression is known to antagonize the dextral activity of Myo31DF in various Drosophila organs. Thus, the LR-reversing activity of overexpressed Myo61F may not reflect its physiological function. The endogenous activity of Myo61F in promoting dextral LR asymmetric development was observed in the male genitalia, but not the embryonic gut, another LR asymmetric organ. Thus, Myo61F and Myo31DF, but not Myo95E, play tissue-specific, redundant roles in LR asymmetric development. Our studies also revealed differential colocalization of the class I myosins with filamentous (F)-actin in the brush border of intestinal enterocytes.},

Molecular interaction between MyoID and Ds in a specific LR organizer controls dextral cell polarity of adjoining hindgut progenitors and is required for organ looping in adults. Loss of Ds blocks hindgut tissue polarization and looping, indicating that Ds is a crucial factor for both LR cue transmission and asymmetric morphogenesis. We further show that the Ds/Fat and Frizzled PCP pathways are required for the spreading of LR asymmetry throughout the hindgut progenitor tissue. These results identify a direct functional coupling between the LR determinant MyoID and PCP, essential for non-autonomous propagation of early LR asymmetry.},

Here, the development of a chiral pattern of actomyosin was revealed by studying actin cytoskeleton self-organization in cells with isotropic circular shape. A radially symmetrical system of actin bundles consisting of $\alpha$-actinin-enriched radial fibres (RFs) and myosin-IIA-enriched transverse fibres (TFs) evolved spontaneously into the chiral system as a result of the unidirectional tilting of all RFs, which was accompanied by a tangential shift in the retrograde movement of TFs. We showed that myosin-IIA-dependent contractile stresses within TFs drive their movement along RFs, which grow centripetally in a formin-dependent fashion. The handedness of the chiral pattern was shown to be regulated by $\alpha$-actinin-1. Computational modelling demonstrated that the dynamics of the RF-TF system can explain the pattern transition from radial to chiral. Thus, actin cytoskeleton self-organization provides built-in machinery that potentially allows cells to develop left-right asymmetry.},

Recently, 'cellular chirality' has attracted attention as a cellular property because it can cause asymmetry in the bodies of animals. In recent in vitro studies, the left-right bias of cellular migration and of autonomous arrangement of cells under some specific culture conditions were discovered. However, it is difficult to identify the molecular mechanism underlying their intrinsic chirality because the left-right bias observed to date is subtle or is manifested in the stable orientation of cells. Here, we report that zebrafish (Danio rerio) melanophores exhibit clear cellular chirality by unidirectional counterclockwise rotational movement under isolated conditions without any special settings. The chirality is intrinsic to melanophores because the direction of the cellular rotation was not affected by the type of extracellular matrix. We further found that the cellular rotation was generated as a counter action of the clockwise movement of actin cytoskeleton. It suggested that the mechanism that directs actin cytoskeleton in the clockwise direction is pivotal for determining cellular chirality.},

However, how epithelial cells coordinate their unidirectional movement while maintaining epithelial integrity is unclear. Here we propose a novel mechanism for collective epithelial cell movement based on Drosophila genitalia rotation, in which epithelial tissue rotates clockwise around the genitalia. We found that this cell movement occurs autonomously and requires myosin II. The moving cells exhibit repeated left–right-biased junction remodelling, while maintaining adhesion with their neighbours, in association with a polarized myosin II distribution. Reducing myosinID, known to cause counter-clockwise epithelial-tissue movement, reverses the myosin II distribution. Numerical simulations revealed that a left–right asymmetry in cell intercalation is sufficient to induce unidirectional cellular movement. The cellular movement direction is also associated with planar cell-shape chirality. These findings support a model in which left–right asymmetric cell intercalation within an epithelial sheet drives collective cellular movement in the same direction.},

abstract = {Many animals show left-right (LR) asymmetric morphology. The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development are evolutionarily divergent, and they remain elusive in invertebrates. Various organs in Drosophila melanogaster show stereotypic LR asymmetry, including the embryonic gut. The Drosophila embryonic hindgut twists 90° left-handedly, thereby generating directional LR asymmetry. We recently revealed that the hindgut epithelial cell is chiral in shape and other properties; this is termed planar cell chirality (PCC). We previously showed by computer modeling that PCC is sufficient to induce the hindgut rotation. In addition, both the PCC and the direction of hindgut twisting are reversed in Myosin31DF (Myo31DF) mutants. Myo31DF encodes Drosophila MyosinID, an actin-based motor protein, whose molecular functions in LR asymmetric development are largely unknown. Here, to understand how PCC directs the asymmetric cell-shape, we analyzed PCC in genetic mosaics composed of cells homozygous for mutant Myo31DF, some of which also overexpressed wild-type Myo31DF. Wild-type cell-shape chirality only formed in the Myo31DF-overexpressing cells, suggesting that cell-shape chirality was established in each cell and reflects intrinsic PCC. A computer model recapitulating the development of this genetic mosaic suggested that mechanical interactions between cells are required for the cell-shape behavior seen in vivo. Our mosaic analysis also suggested that during hindgut rotation in vivo, wild-type Myo31DF suppresses the elongation of cell boundaries, supporting the idea that cell-shape chirality is an intrinsic property determined in each cell. However, the amount and distribution of F-actin and Myosin II, which are known to help generate the contraction force on cell boundaries, did not show differences between Myo31DF mutant cells and wild-type cells, suggesting that the static amount and distribution of these proteins are not involved in the suppression of cell-boundary elongation. Taken together, our results suggest that cell-shape chirality is intrinsically formed in each cell, and that mechanical force from intercellular interactions contributes to its formation and/or maintenance.},

It is only since the 1990s, however, that substantial insight into this problem has been achieved by molecular and genetic approaches. Various genes required for L-R asymmetric morphogenesis in vertebrates have now been identified, and many of these genes are required for the formation and motility of cilia. Breaking of L-R symmetry in the mouse embryo occurs in the ventral node, where two types of cilia are present. Whereas centrally located motile cilia generate a leftward fluid flow, peripherally located immotile cilia sense a flow-dependent signal, which is either chemical or mechanical in nature. Although Ca2+signaling is implicated in flow sensing, the precise mechanism remains unknown. Here we summarize current knowledge of L-R symmetry breaking in vertebrates (focusing on the mouse), with a special emphasis on the roles of cilia, fluid flow, and Ca2+signaling. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The family of inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins is a group of evolutionarily conserved molecules, which play important regulatory roles in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans. Id proteins are small polypeptides harboring a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif, which are best known to mediate dimerization with other basic HLH proteins, primarily E proteins. Because Id proteins do not possess the basic amino acids adjacent to the HLH motif necessary for DNA binding, Id proteins inhibit the function of E protein homodimers, as well as heterodimers between E proteins and tissue-specific bHLH proteins. However, Id proteins have also been shown to have E protein-independent functions. The Id genes are broadly but differentially expressed in a variety of cell types. Transcription of the Id genes is controlled by transcription factors such as C/EBP$\beta$ and Egr as well as by signaling pathways triggered by different stimuli, which include bone morphogenic proteins, cytokines, and ligands of T cell receptors. In general, Id proteins are capable of inhibiting the differentiation of progenitors of different cell types, promoting cell-cycle progression, delaying cellular senescence, and facilitating cell migration. These properties of Id proteins enable them to play significant roles in stem cell maintenance, vasculogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis, the development of the immune system, and energy metabolism. In this review, we intend to highlight the current understanding of the function of Id proteins and discuss gaps in our knowledge about the mechanisms whereby Id proteins exert their diverse effects in multiple cellular processes.},

abstract = {Many developmental processes break left-right (LR) symmetry with a consistent handedness. LR asymmetry emerges early in development, and in many species the primary determinant of this asymmetry has been linked to the cytoskeleton. However, the nature of the underlying chirally asymmetric cytoskeletal processes has remained elusive. In this study, we combine thin-film active chiral fluid theory with experimental analysis of the C. elegans embryo to show that the actomyosin cortex generates active chiral torques to facilitate chiral symmetry breaking. Active torques drive chiral counter-rotating cortical flow in the zygote, depend on myosin activity, and can be altered through mild changes in Rho signaling. Notably, they also execute the chiral skew event at the 4-cell stage to establish the C. elegans LR body axis. Taken together, our results uncover a novel, large-scale physical activity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton that provides a fundamental mechanism for chiral morphogenesis in development.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, left/right (LR) asymmetry is apparent in the directional looping of the gut and male genitalia. The dextral orientation of the organs depends on the activity of a single gene, MyosinID (myoID), whose mutation leads to a fully inverted LR axis, thus revealing the activity of a recessive sinistral pathway. Here, we present the identification of the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) as an upstream regulator of LR determination. This role appears distinct from its function in anteroposterior patterning. We show that the Abd-Bm isoform binds to regulatory sequences of myoID and controls MyoID expression in the organ LR organizer. Abd-Bm is also required for the sinistral pathway. Thus, when Abd-B activity is missing, no symmetry breaking occurs and flies develop symmetrically. These findings identify the Hox gene Abd-B as directing the earliest events of LR asymmetry establishment in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis is dependent on the orchestration of multiple developmental processes to generate mature functional organs. However, the signalling pathways that coordinate morphogenesis and the mechanisms that translate these signals into tissue shape changes are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that changes in intercellular adhesion mediated by the transmembrane protein Fasciclin III (FasIII) represent a key mediator of morphogenesis. Using the embryonic Drosophila hindgut as an in vivo model for organogenesis, we show that the tightening of hindgut curvature that normally occurs between embryonic stage 12 and 15 to generate the characteristic shepherd's crook shape is dependent on localised JAK/STAT pathway activation. This localised pathway activity drives the expression of FasIII leading to its subcellular lateralisation at a stage before formation of septate junctions. Additionally, we show that JAK/STAT- and FasIII-dependent morphogenesis also regulates folds within the third instar wing imaginal disc. We show that FasIII forms homophilic intercellular interactions that promote intercellular adhesion in vivo and in cultured cells. To explore these findings, we have developed a mathematical model of the developing hindgut, based on the differential interfacial tension hypothesis (DITH) linking intercellular adhesion and localised surface tension. Our model suggests that increased intercellular adhesion provided by FasIII can be sufficient to drive the tightening of tube curvature observed. Taken together, these results identify a conserved molecular mechanism that directly links JAK/STAT pathway signalling to intercellular adhesion and that sculpts both tubular and planar epithelial shape.},

abstract = {Animals often show left-right (LR) asymmetry in their body structures. In some vertebrates, the mechanisms underlying LR symmetry breaking and the subsequent signals responsible for LR asymmetric development are well understood. However, in invertebrates, the molecular bases of these processes are largely unknown. Therefore, we have been studying the genetic pathway of LR asymmetric development in Drosophila. The embryonic gut is the first organ that shows directional LR asymmetry during Drosophila development. We performed a genetic screen to identify mutations affecting LR asymmetric development of the embryonic gut. From this screen, we isolated pebble (. pbl), which encodes a homolog of a mammalian RhoGEF, Ect2. The laterality of the hindgut was randomized in embryos homozygous for a null mutant of pbl. Pbl is a multi-functional protein required for cytokinesis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in Drosophila. Consistent with Pbl's role in cytokinesis, we found reduced numbers of cells in the hindgut epithelium in pbl homozygous embryos. The specific expression of pbl in the hindgut epithelium, but not in other tissues, rescued the LR defects and reduced cell number in embryonic pbl homozygotes. Embryos homozygous for string (. stg), a mutant that reduces cell number through a different mechanism, also showed LR defects of the hindgut. However, the reduction in cell number in the pbl mutants was not accompanied by defects in the specification of hindgut epithelial tissues or their integrity. Based on these results, we speculate that the reduction in cell number may be one reason for the LR asymmetry defect of the pbl hindgut, although we cannot exclude contributions from other functions of Pbl, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton through its RhoGEF activity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Vertebrates appear bilaterally symmetric but an internal left–right (L–R) axis is revealed by the placement of asymmetric organs about the midline. For example, the human heart is located to the left of the body cavity, whereas the liver is located to the right. Paired organs can also display L–R differences, as seen in human lungs, in which the right lung has three lobes and the left lung two. Alterations in L–R axis formation can lead to varia-tions in the normal arrangement of organs, including complete inversion of the axis (situs inversus), random-ized placement of organs (heterotaxia or situs ambiguus), and mirror image duplications of paired organs (isomer-ism). In the past 5 years important progress has been made in clarifying the embryological and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of laterality in different vertebrates. Surprisingly, however, it is still un-clear if many of the strategies employed in one group of vertebrates are also applied in other groups. In this re-view, we compare the roles in L–R development ascribed to various molecules and embryological structures in the four common vertebrate model systems. Overview Conceptually, the development of the L–R axis can be divided into three phases: (1) initial break in symmetry; (2) establishment of asymmetric gene expression; and (3) transfer of positional information to developing organs. We will begin our discussion with phases 2 and 3, where several aspects of laterality development appear to be conserved. Namely, members of the Nodal and Lefty families of TGF␤ molecules and the transcription factor Pitx2 are expressed specifically on the left in all verte-brates. We will describe current models on how these genes are implicated in L–R development and discuss how the midline is involved in their regulation. We will then focus on the first phase, when the L–R axis has to be established with respect to the anterior–posterior (A–P) and dorsal–ventral (D–V) axes. A conserved mechanism that establishes asymmetry has not yet been found, but we will describe three strategies that have been impli-cated in this process. First, the node in mouse and chick (corresponding to the organizer in frog) appears to confer laterality, and experiments in mouse suggest a leftward flow of molecules from the node, mediated by the rota-tion of cilia. Second, a localized L–R coordinator that acts as a global regulator of L–R development has been postulated in frog. Third, a role for gap junction commu-nication has been proposed in frog and chick. In the last part of the review, we will describe the genetic cascade in chick that links phases 1 and 2, leading to the transfer of asymmetric gene expression from the node to the pe-riphery. Signaling molecules such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Activin, FGF8, Retinoic acid (RA), and BMP have been implicated in this process. We will discuss the ap-parently divergent roles of many of these factors in other vertebrates.},

Once the gypsy insulator is removed, however, Gal4 is expressed when site-specific recombination between loxP sites is induced by Cre recombinase. This system allowed the mosaic expression of Gal4 in Drosophila embryonic tissues (epidermis, amnioserosa, tracheal system, malpighian tubules, foregut, hindgut, midgut, and neuron), leading to the Gal4-dependent activation of arbitrary genes under the control of the upstream activation sequence (UAS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This practical method can be used to generate mosaic cells in Drosophila embryonic tissues and can be applied to any gene without specialized equipment.},

abstract = {Many animals develop left-right (LR) asymmetry in their internal organs. The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development are evolutionarily divergent, and are poorly understood in invertebrates. Therefore, we studied the genetic pathway of LR asymmetric development in Drosophila. Drosophila has several organs that show directional and stereotypic LR asymmetry, including the embryonic gut, which is the first organ to develop LR asymmetry during Drosophila development. In this study, we found that genes encoding components of the Wnt-signaling pathway are required for LR asymmetric development of the anterior part of the embryonic midgut (AMG). frizzled 2 (fz2) and Wnt4, which encode a receptor and ligand of Wnt signaling, respectively, were required for the LR asymmetric development of the AMG. arrow (arr), an ortholog of the mammalian gene encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6, which is a co-receptor of the Wnt-signaling pathway, was also essential for LR asymmetric development of the AMG. These results are the first demonstration that Wnt signaling contributes to LR asymmetric development in invertebrates, as it does in vertebrates. The AMG consists of visceral muscle and an epithelial tube. Our genetic analyses revealed that Wnt signaling in the visceral muscle but not the epithelium of the midgut is required for the AMG to develop its normal laterality. Furthermore, fz2 and Wnt4 were expressed in the visceral muscles of the midgut. Consistent with these results, we observed that the LR asymmetric rearrangement of the visceral muscle cells, the first visible asymmetry of the developing AMG, did not occur in embryos lacking Wnt4 expression. Our results also suggest that canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling, but not non-canonical Wnt signaling, is responsible for the LR asymmetric development of the AMG. Canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling is reported to have important roles in LR asymmetric development in zebrafish. Thus, the contribution of canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling to LR asymmetric development may be an evolutionarily conserved feature between vertebrates and invertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

How the transcriptional machinery controls residency of stem cells in the niche is unknown. Here we show that Id proteins coordinate stem-cell activities with anchorage of neural stem cells (NSCs) to the niche. Conditional inactivation of three Id genes in NSCs triggered detachment of embryonic and postnatal NSCs from the ventricular and vascular niche, respectively. The interrogation of the gene modules directly targeted by Id deletion in NSCs revealed that Id proteins repress bHLH-mediated activation of Rap1GAP, thus serving to maintain the GTPase activity of RAP1, a key mediator of cell adhesion. Preventing the elevation of the Rap1GAP level countered the consequences of Id loss on NSC-niche interaction and stem-cell identity. Thus, by preserving anchorage of NSCs to the extracellular environment, Id activity synchronizes NSC functions to residency in the specialized niche.},

Thus, to organize LR asymmetry at multiscale levels of morphogenesis, cells with chirality must also be present in adequate numbers. However, observation of LR asymmetry is rarely reported in cultured cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: Using cultured vascular mesenchymal cells, we tested whether LR asymmetry occurs at the single cell level and in self-organized multicellular structures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using micropatterning, immunofluorescence revealed that adult vascular cells polarized rightward and accumulated stress fibers at an unbiased mechanical interface between adhesive and nonadhesive substrates. Green fluorescent protein transfection revealed that the cells each turned rightward at the interface, aligning into a coherent orientation at 20° relative to the interface axis at confluence. During the subsequent aggregation stage, time-lapse videomicroscopy showed that cells migrated along the same 20° angle into neighboring aggregates, resulting in a macroscale structure with LR asymmetry as parallel, diagonal stripes evenly spaced throughout the culture. Removal of substrate interface by shadow mask-plating, or inhibition of Rho kinase or nonmuscle myosin attenuated stress fiber accumulation and abrogated LR asymmetry of both single-cell polarity and multicellular coherence, suggesting that the interface triggers asymmetry via cytoskeletal mechanics. Examination of other cell types suggests that LR asymmetry is cell-type specific.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that adult stem cells retain inherent LR asymmetry that elicits de novo macroscale tissue morphogenesis, indicating that mechanical induction is required for cellular LR specification.},

Different animals use a wide variety of mechanisms to create this axis in the early embryo. In this study, we focus on three animals, including two insects (Drosophila and Tribolium) and a vertebrate (zebrafish) to examine different strategies used to form the AP axis. While Drosophila forms the entire axis within a syncytial blastoderm using transcription factors as morphogens, zebrafish uses signaling factors in a cellularized embryo, progressively forming the AP axis over the course of a day. Tribolium uses an intermediate strategy that has commonalities with both Drosophila and zebrafish. We discuss the specific molecular mechanisms used to create the AP axis and identify conserved features.

Although the molecular mechanism by which pRb controls cell cycle progression is well characterized, how pRb promotes cell-type specification and differentiation is less understood. Here, we report that Extra Macrochaetae (EMC), the Drosophila homolog of inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (ID), is an important protein contributing to the developmental defects caused by Rb deficiency. An emc allele was identified from a genetic screen designed to identify factors that, when overexpressed, cooperate with mutations in rbf1, which encodes one of the two Rb proteins found in Drosophila. EMC overexpression in an rbf1 hypomorphic mutant background induces cone cell and photoreceptor defects but has negligible effects in the wild-type background. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of the rbf1-null ommatidia normally exhibit similar cone cell and photoreceptor defects in the absence of ectopic EMC expression. Detailed EMC expression analyses revealed that RBF1 suppresses expression of both endogenous and ectopic EMC protein in photoreceptors, thus explaining the synergistic effect between EMC overexpression and rbf1 mutations, and the developmental defect observed in rbf1-null ommatidia. Our findings demonstrate that ID family proteins are an evolutionarily conserved determinant of Rb-deficient cells, and play an important role during development.},

abstract = {Left-right (LR) asymmetry (handedness, chirality) is a well-conserved biological property of critical importance to normal development. Changes in orientation of the LR axis due to genetic or environmental factors can lead to malformations and disease. While the LR asymmetry of organs and whole organisms has been extensively studied, little is known about the LR asymmetry at cellular and multicellular levels. Here we show that the cultivation of cell populations on micropatterns with defined boundaries reveals intrinsic cell chirality that can be readily determined by image analysis of cell alignment and directional motion. By patterning 11 different types of cells on ring-shaped micropatterns of various sizes, we found that each cell type exhibited definite LR asymmetry (p value down to 10(-185)) that was different between normal and cancer cells of the same type, and not dependent on surface chemistry, protein coating, or the orientation of the gravitational field. Interestingly, drugs interfering with actin but not microtubule function reversed the LR asymmetry in some cell types. Our results show that micropatterned cell populations exhibit phenotype-specific LR asymmetry that is dependent on the functionality of the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that micropatterning could potentially be used as an effective in vitro tool to study the initiation of LR asymmetry in cell populations, to diagnose disease, and to study factors involved with birth defects in laterality.},

To better understand LR asymmetric morphogenesis in Drosophila, we studied LR directional rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube. Hindgut epithelial cells adopt a LR asymmetric (chiral) cell shape within their plane, and we refer to this cell behavior as planar cell-shape chirality (PCC). Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad) is distributed to cell boundaries with LR asymmetry, which is responsible for the PCC formation. Myosin ID switches the LR polarity found in PCC and in DE-Cad distribution, which coincides with the direction of rotation. An in silico simulation showed that PCC is sufficient to induce the directional rotation of this tissue. Thus, the intrinsic chirality of epithelial cells in vivo is an underlying mechanism for LR asymmetric tissue morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster anterior-posterior axis is established during oogenesis by the localization of bicoid and oskar mRNAs to the anterior and posterior poles of the oocyte. Although genetic screens have identified some trans-acting factors required for the localization of these transcripts, other factors may have been missed because they also function at other stages of oogenesis. To circumvent this problem, we performed a screen for revertants and dominant suppressors of the bicaudal phenotype caused by expressing Miranda-GFP in the female germline. Miranda mislocalizes oskar mRNA/Staufen complexes to the oocyte anterior by coupling them to the bicoid localization pathway, resulting in the formation of an anterior abdomen in place of the head. In one class of revertants, Miranda still binds Staufen/oskar mRNA complexes, but does not localize to the anterior, identifying an anterior targeting domain at the N terminus of Miranda. This has an almost identical sequence to the N terminus of vertebrate RHAMM, which is also a large coiled-coil protein, suggesting that it may be a divergent Miranda ortholog. In addition, we recovered 30 dominant suppressors, including multiple alleles of the spectroplakin, short stop, a lethal complementation group that prevents oskar mRNA anchoring, and a female sterile complementation group that disrupts the anterior localization of bicoid mRNA in late oogenesis. One of the single allele suppressors proved to be a mutation in the actin nucleator, Cappuccino, revealing a previously unrecognized function of Cappuccino in pole plasm anchoring and the induction of actin filaments by Long Oskar protein.},

In this study, we have discovered autonomous rotational motility of the growth cone, which provides a cellular basis for inherent neurite turning. We have developed a technique for monitoring three-dimensional motility of growth cone filopodia and demonstrate that an individual filopodium rotates on its own longitudinal axis in the right-screw direction from the viewpoint of the growth cone body. We also show that the filopodial rotation involves myosins Va and Vb and may be driven by their spiral interactions with filamentous actin. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the unidirectional rotation of filopodia causes deflected neurite elongation, most likely via asymmetric positioning of the filopodia onto the substrate. Although the growth cone itself has been regarded as functionally symmetric, our study reveals the asymmetric nature of growth cone motility.},

We report a mechanism for LR patterning in C. elegans in which the embryo uncouples its midline from the anteroposterior (AP) axis. Specifically, the eight-cell embryo establishes a midline that is tilted rightward from the AP axis and positions more cells on the left, allowing subsequent differential LR fate inductions. To establish the tilted midline, cells exhibit LR asymmetric protrusions and a handed collective movement. This process, termed chiral morphogenesis, involves differential regulation of cortical contractility between a pair of sister cells that are bilateral counterparts fate-wise and is activated by noncanonical Wnt signaling. Chiral morphogenesis is timed by the cytokinetic furrow of a neighbor of the sister pair, providing a developmental clock and an unexpected signaling interaction between the contractile ring and the adjacent cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin-myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin-myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin-myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.},

abstract = {Most animals display internal and/or external left-right asymmetry. Several mechanisms for left-right asymmetry determination have been proposed for vertebrates and invertebrates but they are still not well characterized, particularly at the early developmental stage. The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally. Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two- or four-cell stage) determines the left-right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four- to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness. These manipulated embryos grew to 'dextralized' sinistral and 'sinistralized' dextral snails-that is, normal healthy fertile organisms with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed to that encoded by the mothers' genetic information. Moreover, manipulation reversed the embryonic nodal expression patterns. Using backcrossed F(7) congenic animals, we could demonstrate a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-determining gene(s) and the chiral cytoskeletal dynamics at the third cleavage that promotes the dominant-type blastomere arrangement. These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis. Similar chiral blastomere configuration mechanisms may also operate upstream of the Nodal pathway in left-right patterning of deuterostomes/vertebrates.},

Gene expression analysis by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has been a key enabling technology of the post-genome era. Since the founding of BioTechniques, this journal has been a resource for the improvements in qPCR technology, experimental design, and data analysis. qPCR and, more specifically, real-time qPCR has become a routine and robust approach for measuring the expression of genes of interest, validating microarray experiments, and monitoring biomarkers. The use of real-time qPCR has nearly supplanted other approaches (e.g., Northern blotting, RNase protection assays). This review examines the current state of qPCR for gene expression analysis now that the method has reached a mature stage of development and implementation. Specifically, the different fluorescent reporter technologies of real-time qPCR are discussed as well as the selection of endogenous controls. The conceptual framework for data analysis methods is also presented to demystify these analysis techniques. The future of qPCR remains bright as the technology becomes more rapid, cost-effective, easier to use, and capable of higher throughput.},

Myo31DF and Myo61F have domains conserved in Myosin proteins, particularly in the proteins' head regions. We studied the roles of these domains in LR patterning using overexpression analysis.

This exploratory review of currently available information illuminates the prospective value of Drosophila and pulmonate snails for innovative new research aimed at elucidating these mechanisms. For example, findings in Drosophila and snails suggest that an actin filament-dependent mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved in protostomes. The polarity conservation of primary asymmetry across most metazoan phyla, which visceral handedness represents, indicates developmental constraint and purifying selection as possible but unexplored mechanisms.

Sequencing of the TCF4 transcription factor gene, which is contained in the deletion region, in 30 patients with significant phenotypic overlap revealed heterozygous stop, splice, and missense mutations in five further patients with severe mental retardation and remarkable facial resemblance. Thus, we establish the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome as a distinct but probably heterogeneous entity caused by autosomal dominant de novo mutations in TCF4. Because of its phenotypic overlap, Pitt-Hopkins syndrome evolves as an important differential diagnosis to Angelman and Rett syndromes. Both null and missense mutations impaired the interaction of TCF4 with ASCL1 from the PHOX-RET pathway in transactivating an E box-containing reporter construct; therefore, hyperventilation and Hirschsprung disease in patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome might be explained by altered development of noradrenergic derivatives.},

abstract = {Proneural factors represent {\textless}10 transcriptional regulators required for specifying all of the different neurons of the mammalian nervous system. The mechanisms by which such a small number of factors creates this diversity are still unknown. We propose that proteins interacting with proneural factors confer such specificity. To test this hypothesis we isolated proteins that interact with Math1, a proneural transcription factor essential for the establishment of a neural progenitor population (rhombic lip) that gives rise to multiple hindbrain structures and identified the E-protein Tcf4. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes the Pitt-Hopkins mental retardation syndrome, underscoring the important role for this protein in neural development. To investigate the functional relevance of the Math1/Tcf4 interaction in vivo, we studied Tcf4(-/-) mice and found that they have disrupted pontine nucleus development. Surprisingly, this selective deficit occurs without affecting other rhombic lip-derived nuclei, despite expression of Math1 and Tcf4 throughout the rhombic lip. Importantly, deletion of any of the other E-protein-encoding genes does not have detectable effects on Math1-dependent neurons, suggesting a specialized role for Tcf4 in distinct neural progenitors. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence for an exclusive function of dimers formed between a proneural basic helix-loop-helix factor and a specific E-protein, offering insight about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional programs that regulate development of the mammalian nervous system.},

The mechanisms by which the LR axis is established in vertebrates have been extensively studied. However, how each organ develops its LR asymmetric morphology with respect to the LR axis is still unclear. Here, we showed that Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase (D-JNK) signaling is involved in the LR asymmetric looping of the anterior-midgut (AMG) in Drosophila. Mutant embryos of puckered (puc), which encodes a D-JNK phosphatase, showed random laterality of the AMG. Directional LR looping of the AMG required D-JNK signaling to be down-regulated by puc in the trunk visceral mesoderm. Not only the down-regulation, but also the activation of D-JNK signaling was required for the LR asymmetric looping. We also found that the LR asymmetric cell rearrangement in the circular visceral muscle (CVM) was regulated by D-JNK signaling and required for the LR asymmetric looping of the AMG. Rac1, a Rho family small GTPase, augmented D-JNK signaling in this process. Our results also suggest that a basic mechanism for eliciting LR asymmetric gut looping may be conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many animals have genetically determined left-right (LR) asymmetry of their internal organs. The midline structure of vertebrate embryos has important roles in LR asymmetric development both as the signaling center for LR asymmetry and as a barrier to inappropriate LR signaling across the midline. However, in invertebrates, the functions of the midline in LR asymmetric development are unknown. To elucidate these roles, we studied the involvement of single-minded (sim) in the LR asymmetry of the Drosophila embryonic gut, which develops in a stereotypic, asymmetric manner. sim encodes a bHLH/PAS transcription factor that is required for the development of the ventral midline structure. Here we report that sim was expressed in the midline of the foregut and hindgut primordia. The handedness of the embryonic gut was affected in sim mutant embryos and in embryos overexpressing sim. However, midline-derived events, which involve Slit/Robo and EGFr signaling and direct the development of the tissues adjacent to the midline, did not affect the laterality of this organ, suggesting a crucial role for the midline itself in LR asymmetry. In the sim mutants, the midline structures of the embryonic anal pad were deformed. The mis-expression of sim in the anal-pad primordium induced LR defects. We also found that different portions of the embryonic gut require sim functions at different times for normal LR asymmetry. Our results suggest that the midline structures are involved in the LR asymmetric development of the Drosophila embryonic gut. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, the molecular nature of the determinant(s) responsible for the invariant orientation of the left-right axis (situs choice) remains largely unknown. Mutations producing a complete reversal of left-right asymmetry (situs inversus) are instrumental for identifying mechanisms controlling handedness, yet only one such mutation has been found in mice (inversin) and snails. Here we identify the conserved type ID unconventional myosin 31DF gene (Myo31DF) as a unique situs inversus locus in Drosophila. Myo31DF mutations reverse the dextral looping of genitalia, a prominent left-right marker in adult flies. Genetic mosaic analysis pinpoints the A8 segment of the genital disc as a left-right organizer and reveals an anterior-posterior compartmentalization of Myo31DF function that directs dextral development and represses a sinistral default state. As expected of a determinant, Myo31DF has a trigger-like function and is expressed symmetrically in the organizer, and its symmetrical overexpression does not impair left-right asymmetry. Thus Myo31DF is a dextral gene with actin-based motor activity controlling situs choice. Like mouse inversin, Myo31DF interacts and colocalizes with beta-catenin, suggesting that situs inversus genes can direct left-right development through the adherens junction.},

Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of cilia that are tilted toward the posterior on cells of the ventral node. These cilia are built by transport via the KIF3 motor complex. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left-right asymmetry has been a matter of debate.

abstract = {A rationale for the complex-appearing generation of the primary body axes in vertebrates can be obtained if this process is divided into two parts. First, an ancestral system is responsible for the anteroposterior (AP) patterning of the brain and the positioning of the heart. The blastopore (marginal zone) acts as a source region that generates primary AP-positional information for the brain, a process that is largely independent of the organizer. This evolutionary old system was once organizing the single axis of radial-symmetric ancestors. Second, the trunk is assumed to be an evolutionary later addition. The AP organization of the trunk depends on a time-controlled posterior transformation in which an oscillation plays a crucial role. This oscillation also leads to the repetitive nature of the trunk pattern as seen in somites or segments. The function of the Spemann-type organizer is not to specify the dorsoventral (DV) positional information directly but to initiate the formation of a stripe-shaped midline organizer, realized with different structures in the brain and in the trunk (prechordal plate vs. notochord). The distance of the cells to this midline (rather than to the organizer) is crucial for the DV specification. The basically different modes of axes formation in vertebrates and insects is proposed to have their origin in the initial positioning of the mesoderm. Only in vertebrates the mesoderm is initiated in a ring at a posterior position. Thus, only in vertebrates complex tissue movements are required to transform the ring-shaped posterior mesoderm into the rod-shaped axial structures.},

abstract = {In many animal groups, left-right (LR) asymmetry within the body is observed. The left and right sides of the body are generally defined with reference to the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes. In this study, we investigated whether LR asymmetry is solely dependent on the AP and DV polarities in Drosophila embryos. We focused on the proventriculus, a posterior part of the foregut, and the hindgut because LR asymmetry in these body parts is highly stable in normal embryos. In embryos with a fully reversed AP polarity, LR asymmetry in both the proventriculus and the hindgut was re-oriented in relation to the reversed AP polarity. This demonstrates that inversion of AP polarity does not affect LR asymmetry of these tissues, and implies that LR asymmetry is specified in relation to the AP and DV polarities. Our findings were not consistent with the alternative hypothesis that LR asymmetry is predetermined by maternal signals that localize asymmetrically along the LR axis in the oocyte and/or early embryo.},

While the patterning of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes has been increasingly well characterized, the left-right (LR) axis has only recently begun to be understood at the molecular level. The mechanisms which ensure invariant LR asymmetry of the heart, viscera, and brain represent a thread connecting biomolecular chirality to human cognition, along the way involving fundamental aspects of cell biology, biophysics, and evolutionary biology. An understanding of LR asymmetry is important not only for basic science, but also for the biomedicine of a wide range of birth defects and human genetic syndromes. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding LR patterning in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate species, discusses several poorly understood but important phenomena, and highlights some important open questions about the evolutionary origin and conservation of mechanisms underlying embryonic asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The Drosophila ovary provides a model system for studying the mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of somatic stem cells into specific cell types. Ovarian somatic stem cells produce follicle cells, which undergo a binary choice during early differentiation. They can become either epithelial cells that surround the germline to form an egg chamber ('main body cells') or a specialized cell lineage found at the poles of egg chambers. This lineage goes on to make two cell types: polar cells and stalk cells. To better understand how this choice is made, we carried out a screen for genes that affect follicle cell fate specification or differentiation. We identified extra macrochaetae (emc), which encodes a helix-loop-helix protein, as a downstream effector of Notch signaling in the ovary. EMC is expressed in proliferating cells in the germarium, as well as in the main body follicle cells. EMC expression in the main body cells is Notch dependent, and emc mutant cells located on the main body failed to differentiate. EMC expression is reduced in the precursors of the polar and stalk cells, and overexpression of EMC caused dramatic egg chamber fusions, indicating that EMC is a negative regulator of polar and/or stalk cells. EMC and Notch were both required in the main body cells for expression of Eyes Absent (EYA), a negative regulator of polar and stalk cell fate. We propose that EMC functions downstream of Notch and upstream of EYA to regulate main body cell fate specification and differentiation.},

However, the function of Ids during bone formation in vivo has not yet been elucidated. We, therefore, examined the role of Id1 and Id3 in the regulation of bone metabolism in vivo. Using wild type and Id1/Id3 heterozygous knockout mice, we analyzed calvarial bone formation in the suture by X-ray picture, proliferation, and mineralization activities of primary calvarial osteoblasts by MTT assay and alizarin red staining and onthotopic in vivo bone formation by BMP injection onto calvaria and micro CT analysis. The width of calvarial sutures was reduced by more than 50{\%} in Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out mice. Analyses on the cellular basis for the mechanism underlying the defects in the mutant mice revealed suppression of proliferation and mineralization in osteoblasts derived from Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out mice. Furthermore, Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out mice suppressed BMP-induced bone formation in vivo. These results indicated that Id1 and Id3 are positive factors to promote bone formation in vivo.},

abstract = {Determination of the vertebrate left-right body axis during embryogenesis results in asymmetric development and placement of most inner organs [1, 2]. Although the asymmetric Nodal cascade is conserved in all vertebrates, the mechanism of symmetry breakage has remained controversial [3]. In mammalian and fish embryos, a cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluid is required for initiation of the Nodal cascade. This flow is localized at the posterior notochord ("node") and Kupffer's vesicle, respectively [4-7]. In frog and chick embryos, however, molecular asymmetries are required earlier, from cleavage stages through gastrulation [8, 9]. The validity of a cilia-based mechanism for all vertebrates therefore has been questioned [3]. Here we show that a cilia-driven leftward flow precedes asymmetric nodal expression in the frog Xenopus. Motile monocilia emerged on the gastrocoel roof plate during neurulation and lengthened and polarized from an initially central position to the posterior pole of??cells. Concomitantly, a robust leftward fluid flow developed from stage 15 onward, significantly before asymmetric nodal transcription started in the left-lateral-plate mesoderm at stage 19. Injection of 1.5{\%} methylcellulose into the archenteron prevented leftward flow and resulted in laterality defects, demonstrating that the flow itself was required for asymmetric gene expression and organ placement. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The vertebrate body plan has conserved handed left-right (LR) asymmetry that is manifested in the heart, lungs, and gut. Leftward flow of extracellular fluid at the node (nodal flow) is critical for normal LR axis determination in the mouse. Nodal flow is generated by motile node cell monocilia and requires the axonemal dynein, left-right dynein (lrd). In the absence of lrd, LR determination becomes random. The cation channel polycystin-2 is also required to establish LR asymmetry. We show that lrd localizes to a centrally located subset of node monocilia, while polycystin-2 is found in all node monocilia. Asymmetric calcium signaling appears at the left margin of the node coincident with nodal flow. These observations suggest that LR asymmetry is established by an entirely ciliary mechanism: motile, lrd-containing monocilia generate nodal flow, and nonmotile polycystin-2 containing cilia sense nodal flow initiating an asymmetric calcium signal at the left border of the node.},

abstract = {In vertebrate development, the establishment of left-right asymmetry is essential for sidedness and the directional looping of organs like the heart. Both the nodal pathway and retinoic acid play major and conserved regulatory roles in these processes. We carried out a novel screen in Drosophila to identify mutants that specifically affect the looping of left-right asymmetric organs. We report the isolation of spin, a novel mutant in which the looping of the genitalia and spermiduct are incomplete; under-rotation of the genitalia indicates that spin controls looping morphogenesis but not direction, thus uncoupling left-right asymmetry and looping morphogenesis. spin is a novel, rotation-specific allele of the fasciclin2 (Fas2) gene, which encodes a cell-adhesion protein involved in several aspects of neurogenesis. In spin mutants, the synapses connecting specific neurosecretory cells to the corpora allata are affected. The corpus allatum is part of the ring gland and is involved in the control of juvenile hormone titers during development. Our genetic and pharmacological results indicate that Fas2(spin) rotation defects are linked to an abnormal endocrine function and an elevated level of juvenile hormone. As juvenile hormone is an insect sesquiterpenoid related to retinoic acid, these results establish a new genetic model for studying organ looping and demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for terpenoids in this process.},

abstract = {Background: Gut formation is a key event during animal development. Recent genetic analysis in chick, mice, and Drosophila has identified Hedgehog and TGF{\ss} signals as essential players for the development of the primitive gut tube along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis. However, the genetic programs that control gut patterning along its dorsoventral (DV) axis have remained largely elusive. Results: We demonstrate that the activation of the Notch receptor occurs in a single row of boundary cells which separates dorsal from ventral cells in the Drosophila hindgut. rhomboid, which encodes a transmembrane protein, and knirps/knirps-related, which encode nuclear steroid receptors, are Notch target genes required for the expression of crumbs, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in organizing apical-basal polarity. Notch receptor activation depends on the expression of its ligand Delta in ventral cells, and localizing the Notch receptor to the apical domain of the boundary cells may be required for proper signaling. The analysis of gene expression mediated by a Notch response element suggests that boundary cell-specific expression can be obtained by cooperation of Suppressor of Hairless and the transcription factor Grainyhead or a related factor. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in determining cell fates along the DV axis of the Drosophila hindgut. The finding that Notch signaling results in the expression of an apical polarity organizer which may be required, in turn, for apical Notch receptor localization suggests a simple mechanism by which the specification of a single cell row might be controlled.},

The aim of this revision is to analyse the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae in our area and to compare these data with those from the rest of Spain and from other European countries. We have analysed 785 strains isolated from patients who attended in Vall d'Hebron Hospital, in the Drassanes STD clinic and in 150 primary care centres in Barcelona, from July to December 2011 and from January 2013 to December 2014. Along all this period, we have observed an increase in penicillin resistance rate. From 2011 to 2013, the rate of azitromycin resistance raised, but from 2013 to 2014, it decreased. From 2011 to 2013, the CMI50 and CMI90 of cefixime increased from 0.016 and 0.125 mg/l to 0.032 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. In contrast, from 2013 to 2014, they decreased from 0.032 and 0.25 mg/l to 0.016 and 0.094 mg/l. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was about 50{\%} along these three years. All the strains remained susceptible to spectinomycin. Looking through European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP) data, Spain has higher resistance rates than the European average. In 2011, 15{\%} of the Spanish strains presented decreased susceptibility (DS) to cefixime, which was twofold higher than the mean of the European strains. The same happened with azithromycin; in Spain, 14{\%} of the strains were resistant, whilst in Europe, the mean of resistance was 5.3{\%}. In conclusion, although there is a fear that gonococcus can become a 'superbug', looking through our data and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) data, we can be optimistic, because since 2011 no strain with high resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) has been reported, and strains with DS to these antibiotics are declining since the end of 2013. However, resistance to azithromycin is increasing.},

From analyzing daughterless (da) loss-of-function, overexpression and genetic interaction phenotypes, we have identified several specific requirements for da(+) in somatic cells during follicle formation. First, da is a critical regulator of somatic cell proliferation. Also, da is required for the complete differentiation of polar and stalk cells, and elevated da levels can even drive the convergence and extension that is characteristic of interfollicular stalks. Finally, da is a genetic regulator of an early checkpoint for germline cyst progression: Loss of da function inhibits normally occurring apoptosis of germline cysts at the region 2a/2b boundary of the germarium, while da overexpression leads to postmitotic cyst degradation. Collectively, these da functions govern the abundance and diversity of somatic cells as they coordinate with germline cysts to form functional follicles.},

abstract = {The Drosophila hindgut is fruitful territory for investigation of events common to many types of organogenesis. The development of the Drosophila hindgut provides, in microcosm, a genetic model system for studying processes such as establishment (patterning) of an epithelial primordium, its internalization by gastrulation, development of left-right asymmetric looping, patterning in both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes, innervation, investment of an epithelium with mesoderm, reciprocal epitheliomesenchymal interactions, cell shape change, and cell rearrangement. We review the genetic control of these processes during development of the Drosophila hindgut, and compare these to related processes in other bilaterians, particularly vertebrates. We propose that caudal/Cdx, brachyenteron/Brachyury, fork head/HNF-3, and wingless/Wnt constitute a conserved "cassette" of genes expressed in the blastopore and later in the gut, involved in posterior patterning, cell rearrangement, and gut maintenance. Elongation of the internalized Drosophila hindgut primordium is similar to elongation of the archenteron and also of the entire embryonic axis (both during and after gastrulation), as well as of various tubules (e.g., nephric ducts, Malpighian tubules), as it is driven by cell rearrangement. The genes drumstick, bowl, and lines (which encode putative transcriptional regulators) are required for this cell rearrangement, as well as for spatially localized gene expression required to establish the three morphologically distinct subregions of the hindgut. Expression of signaling molecules regulated by drumstick, bowl, and lines, in particular of the JAK/STAT activator Unpaired at the hindgut anterior, may play a role in controlling hindgut cell rearrangement. Other cell signaling molecules expressed in the hindgut epithelium are required to establish its normal size (Dpp and Hh), and to establish and maintain the hindgut visceral mesoderm (Wg and Hh). Both maternal gene activity and zygotic gene activity are required for asymmetric left-right looping of the hindgut. Some of the same genes (caudal and brachyenteron) required for embryonic hindgut development also act during pupation to construct a new hindgut from imaginal cells. Application of the plethora of genetic techniques available in Drosophila, including forward genetic screens, should identify additional genes controlling hindgut development and thus shed light on a variety of common morphogenetic processes. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Vertebrates share Phylum Chordata with two other groups of animals, amphioxus and the urochordates (including ascidians). Both these taxa develop left–right asymmetries, and recent studies have begun to address the degree of conservation of nodal and Pitx2 in this process. Pitx2 is a member of the Pitx homeobox gene family, and in both amphioxus and ascidians Pitx gene expression is predominantly left sided.

These thresholds initiate the differentiation of the three primary embryonic tissues: the mesoderm, neurogenic ectoderm, and dorsal ectoderm. Moreover, primary readouts of the Dorsal gradient create asymmetries that subdivide each tissue into multiple cell types during gastrulation. Dorsal patterning thresholds represent the culmination of one of the most complete gene regulation network known in development, which begins with the asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus within the egg chamber and leads to the localized activation of the Toll-Dorsal signaling pathway in ventral regions of the early embryo. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Here we show that the expression of wingless (wg), hedgehog (hh), decapentaplegic (dpp), and engrailed (en) corresponds to the generation or growth of particular domains of the hindgut. wg, expressed in the prospective anal pads, is necessary for activation of hh in the adjacent prospective rectum. hh is expressed in the prospective rectum, which forms anteriorly to the anal pads, and necessary for the expression of dpp at the posterior end of the adjacent large intestine. wg and hh are also necessary for the development of their own expression domains, anal pads, and rectum, respectively. dpp, in turn, causes the growth of the large intestine, promoting DNA replication. en defines the dorsal domain of the large intestine, repressing dpp in this domain. A one-cell-wide domain, which delineates the anterior and posterior borders of the large intestine and its internal border between the dorsal and ventral domains, is induced by the activity of en. We propose a model for the gene regulatory pathways leading to the subdivision of the hindgut into domains. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The Drosophila embryonic hindgut is a robust system for the study of patterning and morphogenesis of epithelial organs. We show that, in a period of about 10 h, and in the absence of significant cell division or apoptosis, the hindgut epithelium undergoes morphogenesis by changes in cell shape and size and by cell rearrangement. The epithelium concomitantly becomes surrounded by visceral mesoderm and is characterized by distinct gene expression patterns that forecast the development of three morphological subdomains: small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. At least three genes encoding putative transcriptional regulators, drumstick (drm), bowl, and lines (lin), are required to establish normal hindgut morphology. We show that the defect in hindgut elongation in drm, bowl, and lin mutants is due, in large part, to the requirement of these genes in the process of cell rearrangement. Further, we show that drm, bowl, and lin are required for patterning of the hindgut, i.e., for correct expression in the prospective small intestine, large intestine, and rectum of genes encoding cell signals (wingless, hedgehog, unpaired, Serrate, dpp) and transcription factors (engrailed, dead ringer). The close association of both cell rearrangement and patterning defects in all three mutants suggest that proper patterning of the hindgut into small intestine and large intestine is likely required for its correct morphogenesis. {\textcopyright} 20Ol Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {Neurulation occurs during the early embryogenesis of chordates, and it results in the formation of the neural tube, a dorsal hollow nerve cord that constitutes the rudiment of the entire adult central nervous system. The goal of studies on neurulation is to understand its tissue, cellular and molecular basis, as well as how neurulation is perturbed during the formation of neural tube defects. The tissue basis of neurulation consists of a series of coordinated morphogenetic movements within the primitive streak (e.g., regression of Hensen's node) and nascent primary germ layers formed during gastrulation. Signaling occurs between Hensen's node and the nascent ectoderm, initiating neurulation by inducing the neural plate (i.e., actually, by suppressing development of the epidermal ectoderm). Tissue movements subsequently result in shaping and bending of the neural plate and closure of the neural groove. The cellular basis of the tissue movements of neurulation consists of changes in the behavior of the constituent cells; namely, changes in cell number, position, shape, size and adhesion. Neurulation, like any morphogenetic event, occurs within the milieu of generic biophysical determinants of form present in all living tissues. Such forces govern and to some degree control morphogenesis in a tissue-autonomous manner. The molecular basis of neurulation remains largely unknown, but we suggest that neurulation genes have evolved to work in concert with such determinants, so that appropriate changes occur in the behaviors of the correct populations of cells at the correct time, maximizing the efficiency of neurulation and leading to heritable species- and axial-differences in this process. In this article, we review the tissue and cellular basis of neurulation and provide strategies to determine its molecular basis. We expect that such strategies will lead to the identification in the near future of critical neurulation genes, genes that when mutated perturb neurulation in a highly specific and predictable fashion and cause neurulation defects, thereby contributing to the formation of neural tube defects.},

abstract = {Most animals exhibit stable left-right asymmetries in their body. Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms that set up these asymmetries in vertebrates, nothing is known about them in Drosophila. This is usually attributed to the fact that no reversals of stable left-right asymmetries have been observed in Drosophila, although relevant surveys have been carried out. We have focused on the asymmetry of the proventriculus in the embryonic gut of Drosophila, an aspect of left-right asymmetry that is extremely stable in wild-type flies. We show that this asymmetry can be reversed by mutations in the dicephalic and wunen genes, which also cause reversals in the antero-posterior axis of the embryo relative to its mother. This is the first observation to suggest that left-right asymmetries in Drosophila can be reversed by genetic/developmental manipulations. It also suggests that maternal signals may initiate the specification of some left-right asymmetries in the embryo.},

We determined that enforced expression of all four different mammalian members of this family, E12, E47, E2-2, and HEB, suppresses the cell colony-forming efficiency of several cell lines. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which class A bHLH factors affect cell growth, we have investigated their role in the transcriptional regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. We found that p21CIP1/ WAF1, p15INK4B, and p16INK4B promoter sequences contain E-boxes that render these genes competent for class A bHLH-mediated transcriptional activation and Id-mediated repression. The mechanism underlying the class A bHLH-mediated inhibition of cell growth does not involve an arrest of G1 progression in 293T cells. In fact, contrary to what has been found in 3T3 NIH fibroblasts, we found that enhanced expression of class A bHLH proteins led to a decreased proliferation rate by promoting cell death associated with the induction of apoptosis. These findings highlight the role of the class A bHLH proteins as general negative regulators of cell proliferation through a mechanism(s) that involves both enhancement of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes expression and promotion of cell death.},

Some phenotypes caused by extramacrochaetae in the wing are similar to those observed when Notch signalling is compromised. Furthermore, maximal levels of extramacrochaetae expression in the wing disc are restricted to places where Notch activity is higher, suggesting that extramacrochaetae could mediate some aspects of Notch signalling during wing development. We have studied the relationships between extramacrochaetae and Notch in wing development, with emphasis on the processes of vein formation and cell proliferation. We observe strong genetic interaction between extramacrochaetae and different components of the Notch signalling pathway, suggesting a functional relationship between them. We show that the higher level of extramacrochaetae expression coincides with the domain of expression of Notch and its downstream gene Enhancer of split-m(beta). The expression of extramacrochaetae at the dorso/ventral boundary and in boundary cells between veins and interveins depends on Notch activity. We propose that at least during vein differentiation and wing margin formation, extramacrochaetae is regulated by Notch and collaborates with other Notch-downstream genes such as Enhancer of split-m(beta).},

The function of emc is required in many developmental processes during the development of Drosophila, including wing morphogenesis.

The study of relationships between emc and different genes involved in wing development reveal strong genetic interactions with genes of the Ras signalling pathway (torpedo, vein, veinlet and Gap), blistered, plexus and net, in both adult wing phenotypes and cell behaviour in genetic mosaics. These interactions are also analyzed as variations of emc expression patterns in mutant backgrounds for these genes. In addition, cell proliferation behaviour of emc mutant cells varies depending on the mutant background. The results show that genes of the Ras signalling pathway are co- operatively involved in the activity of emc during cell proliferation, and later antagonistically during cell differentiation, repressing EMC expression.},

abstract = {Multidomain proteins usually contain several conserved and apparently independently evolved domains. As a result, classifications based on only a single small domain may obscure the true evolutionary relationships of the proteins. The current classification of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing proteins is based on the conserved bHLH domain alone. Herein, we explore whether sequence homology and, therefore, evolutionary relationships can be detected among the flanking or non-bHLH components of the amino acid sequences of 122 bHLH proteins. These 122 proteins were the same proteins previously used to construct the existing classification of the bHLH-domain-containing proteins. Several possible scenarios are examined in order to explain the observed patterns of sequence divergence, including (1) monophyly, (2) convergent evolution, (3) addition of functional components to the bHLH domain, and (4) modular evolution with domain shuffling. Drawing on several lines of evidence, we suggest that modular evolution by domain shuffling may have played an important role in the evolution of this large group of transcriptional regulators.},

abstract = {Basic helix-loop-helix proteins, which are tissue specific (SCL) or broadly expressed (E proteins), interact positively to regulate erythroid specific genes. Here, expression of SCL and two broadly expressed E proteins, E47 and HEB, was high early in erythroid differentiation and declined during maturation. Stimulation of erythroid progenitors/precursors with stem cell factor (SCF) enhanced SCL and E protein levels, one mechanism by which SCF may increase erythroid proliferation. Interactions between SCL and E proteins are competed by Id2, which binds and sequesters E proteins. Upregulation of Id2, demonstrated here late in erythroid differentiation, may downregulate genes involved in erythroid proliferation/differentiation. We examined expression of bHLH proteins in transfusion-dependent patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) to determine if these interactions are disrupted. In erythroblasts from patients, expression of SCL protein and mRNA was normal and SCL increased in response to SCF. However, E47 and HEB protein levels were significantly decreased. Id2 was strongly expressed in patients. Through reduction of SCL/E protein heterodimer formation, abnormal levels of bHLH transcription factors may affect expression of erythroid specific genes, such as beta globin. Stimulation of Diamond-Blackfan cells with SCF partially compensated for this defect, enhancing expression of E47, HEB, and SCL. SCF may function to increase SCL/E protein heterodimer formation, which may be one of the mechanisms through which SCF stimulates erythroid proliferation/differentiation in DBA.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The helix-loop-helix transcription factor E2A plays important roles not only in promoting cellular differentiation but also in suppressing cell growth. Id proteins, the inhibitors of E2A, have opposite effects on cell differentiation and growth. To understand the mechanisms by which E2A suppresses cell growth, we examined the role of E2A in regulating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1/SD11, which prevents cell cycle progression upon overexpression. By using transient-cotransfection assays of luciferase reporter constructs in HeLa cells, we have found that overexpression of E2A can transcriptionally activate the p21 gene. To identify the sequences that mediate this activation in the promoter of the p21 gene, we carried out mutational analyses. Out of the eight putative E2A-binding sequences (E1 to E8) in the promoter, the E1 to E3 sequences located close to the transcription start site are found to be essential. In addition, loss of the E boxes in the promoter also reduces p21 expression without cotransfection with E2A in HIT pancreatic cells, where the endogenous E2A-like activity is high. Furthermore, we have also shown that overexpression of E2A in 293T cells activates expression of the endogenous p21 gene at both the levels of mRNA and protein. In correlation with the finding that E47 overexpression leads to growth arrest in NIH 3T3 cells, we have shown that Id1 overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells accelerates cell growth and inhibits p21 expression. Taken together, these results provide insight into the mechanisms by which E2A and Id proteins control cell growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To further analyze the function of proneural genes, we have studied the effects of Gal4-mediated expression of lethal of scute, a member of the AS-C, during embryogenesis. Expression of lethal of scute forces progenitor cells of larval internal sensory organs, which are normally committed to this fate independently of the activity of the AS-C, to take on features of external sensory organs. Supernumerary neural cells can be induced ectopically only if daughterless is overexpressed, either alone or together with lethal of scute: cells of the amnioserosa and the hindgut then express neuronal markers. Furthermore, cells of the proctodeal anlage, which normally lack neural competence, acquire the ability to develop as neuroblasts following transplantation into the neuroectoderm. We show here that activated Notch prevents the cells of the neuroectoderm from forming extra neural tissue when they express an excess of proneural proteins. Under the present conditions, lateral inhibition is thus dominant over the activity of proneural genes.},

It has been shown that various dorsoventral patterning genes that are evolutionarily conserved between insects and vertebrates are expressed dorsally in insects, and ventrally in vertebrates, or vice versa. The ventral body side of insects thus seems to correspond to the dorsal body side of vertebrates, and these are the nerve cord-bearing, neural body sides in both groups. In order to exclude that the inverted polarity of gene patterning activity is purely accidental, we compare here vertebrate and invertebrate blastula fate maps and their gastrulation patterns in the framework of early gene expression. From this comparison it appears that the neural body sides, 'ventral' in annelids or arthropods, and 'dorsal' in chordates, develop at similar positions with respect to the initial egg asymmetry. In addition, the formation of the neural body sides involves similar movements during gastrulation. We further suggest that the deuterostome gastrulation seen in today's chordates can be derived from a more ancestral gastrulation pattern seen in today's annelids and arthropods, and that the ventral midline cells of insects correspond to the dorsal midline cells of vertebrates.},

Two serines N terminal to the deltaE47 basic helix-loop-helix domain were found to be phosphorylated in a variety of cell types but were hypophosphorylated in B cells. Phosphorylating these serines in vitro inhibited DNA binding by deltaE47 homodimers but not by deltaE47-containing heterodimers, such as deltaE47:MyoD. These results argue that hypophosphorylation may be a prerequisite for activity of E47 homodimers in B cells, suggesting the use of an inductive (nonstochastic) step in early B-cell development.},

abstract = {Vertebrate nuclear lamins form a multigene family with developmentally controlled expression. In contrast, invertebrates have long been thought to contain only a single lamin, which in Drosophila is the well-characterized lamin Dm0. Recently, however, a Drosophila cDNA clone (pG-IF) has been identified that codes for an intermediate filament protein which harbors a nuclear localization signal but lacks a carboxy-terminal CAAX motif. Based on these data the putative protein encoded by pG-IF was tentatively called Drosophila lamin C. To address whether the pG-IF encoded protein is expressed and whether it encodes a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein or a nuclear lamin we raised antibodies against the recombinant pG-IF protein. The antibodies decorate the nuclear envelope in Drosophila Kc tissue culture cells as well as in salivary and accessory glands demonstrating that pG-IF encodes a nuclear lamin (lamin C). Antibody decoration, in situ hybridization, western and northern blotting studies show that lamin C is acquired late in embryogenesis. In contrast, lamin Dm0 is constitutively expressed. Lamin C is first detected in late stage 12 embryos in oenocytes, hindgut and posterior spiracles and subsequently also in other differentiated tissues. In third instar larvae lamins C and Dm0 are coexpressed in all tissues tested. Thus, Drosophila has two lamins: lamin Dm0, containing a CaaX motif, is expressed throughout, while lamin C, lacking a CaaX motif, is expressed only later in development. Expression of Drosophila lamin C is similar to that of vertebrate lamin A (plus C), which loses its CaaX motif during incorporation into the lamina.},

Mosaic analysis of hypomorphic conditions of emc reveals the tendency of mutant cells to proliferate along the veins as long stripes. Large clones abuting two adjacent veins obliterate the corresponding inter-vein, affecting the size and shape of the whole wing. Thus, the emc gene participates in the control of cell proliferation within inter-vein regions in the wing. Similar effects were found in the haltere and in the leg. The behavior of emc cells in genetic mosaics indicate that (1) proliferation is locally controlled within inter-vein sectors, (2) cells proliferate according to their genetic activity along preferential positions in the wing morphogenetic landscape and (3) cell proliferation in the wing is integrated by 'accommodation' between mutant and wild type cells. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The da protein dimerizes with AS-C products in vitro to form DNA-binding proteins. Previous studies have shown that the AS-C genes are expressed initially in discrete clusters of ectodermal cells (the proneural clusters) and then more strongly in the neuronal precursors that arise from these clusters and delaminate from the epidermal layer. In this paper, we studied the distribution of da protein with an antibody raised against Da. We found that Da is ubiquitously but non-uniformly distributed. Within the ectodermal layer, its level is neither elevated (as in the case of AS-C genes) nor reduced (as in the case of emc product) in the proneural cluster. It is, however, at higher levels in many neuronal precursors. We further studied the requirement of da in neuronal precursor development by using a variety of markers for neuronal precursors. Our results reveal the existence of at least two stages in neuronal precursor formation. da is not required for the initial appearance of nascent neuronal precursors but is required for these cells to express multiple neuronal precursor genes and to produce the normal number of neurons.},

By increasing the amount of E47 with an inducible system or neutralizing the endogenous Id with microinjected anti-Id antibodies, withdrawal from the cell cycle occurred within hours before the G1-S transition point. The combined results suggest that the Id proteins are required for G1 progression.

Severe, but viable, hypomorphic da mutant genotypes exhibit dramatic defects during oogenesis, including aberrantly defined follicles and loss of interfollicular stalks. The follicular defects observed in da mutant ovaries are qualitatively very similar to those described in Notch (N) or Delta (Dl) mutant ovaries. Moreover, in the ovary da- alleles exhibit dominant synergistic interactions with N or Dl mutations.

abstract = {We have identified a zebrafish homologue of the human E12 protein, which we have called ZfE12. It shows a high degree of identify to hE12 throughout its entire sequence, particularly in the bHLH domain (93{\%}); amino acid sequence identify of the bHLH domain of ZfE12 to Drosophila daughterless is also very high (75{\%}). During early embryogenesis, expression of ZfE12 is widespread. Following gastrulation, ZfE12 transcripts can be detected in all tissues with the exception of the notochord, although zones with relatively higher densities of transcripts are present in the developing brain and in the somites. To assay biological activities associated with the ZfE12 protein, two P-element constructs were made, each carrying a Drosophila daughterless gene that had been modified by replacing either the HLH domain or the entire C-terminus including the bHLH domain, by the equivalent domains of ZfE12. These constructs were used to transform flies and tested for their ability to rescue the daughterless mutant phenotype. Complete rescue of the neural phenotype and of the embryonic lethality was obtained. However, the daughterless function could not be completely restored. Although fertile flies transheterozygous for a hypomorphic and an amorphic mutation and carrying the construct encoding the zebrafish HLH domain emerged, they lacked varioys types of sensory organs on head and thorax and showed slight wing defects. Mutants carrying the second construct occasionally reached pupal stages but died subsequently. These data demonstrate that the HLH domain of ZfE12 can carry out most, but not all, functions performed by the corresponding region of the daughterless protein in Drosophila. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Although zygotic emc function is required for embryonic viability, its role in embryogenesis is not well understood. We describe here the distribution of emc transcripts during embryonic development. We also show that emc transcript is maternally contributed. Finally, we demonstrate that emc function is required for normal midgut and Malpighian tubule development.

abstract = {The daughterless (da) gene in Drosophila functions in the regulation of at least three significant developmental pathways: sex determination, neurogenesis and oogenesis. As a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of DNA binding proteins, the da gene product appears to act as a transcription factor. Based on the genetic and molecular characterization of da, it has been proposed that the da protein (Da) functions as a generic member of this family, serving throughout development as a necessary binding partner for an assortment of other HLH proteins. As a result of temporally and/or spatially restricted expression, these binding partners would provide some regulatory specificity to the functional transcription complex. In order to participate in this way in the regulation of multiple genes, Da must be expressed in numerous times and places during development. Using anti-Da antibodies, we validate two predictions of this scenario of Da function: (1) Da protein is not only nuclear localized, but also associated with chromosomes in vivo; and (2) Da protein is widely distributed, both spatially and temporally, throughout development. With regard to the essential role of maternal da+in progeny sex determination little, if any, Da protein is synthesized in the maternal germline. This suggests that the female-specific germline function of da+is provided to the zygote as maternally synthesized RNA that becomes translated early in embryogenesis. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

We show that pRB inactivation, through either phosphorylation, binding to T antigen, or genetic alteration, inhibits myogenesis. Moreover, inactivation of pRB in terminally differentiated cells allows them to reenter the cell cycle. In addition to its involvement in the myogenic activities of MyoD, pRB is also required for the cell growth-inhibitory activity of this myogenic factor. We also show that pRB and MyoD directly bind to each other, both in vivo and in vitro, through a region that involves the pocket and the basic-helix-loop-helix domains, respectively. All the results obtained are consistent with the proposal that the effects of MyoD on the cell cycle and of pRB on the myogenic pathway result from the direct binding of the two molecules. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

In both cases, the h protein behaves as a transcriptional repressor. In this study, we determined the molecular nature of 12 h alleles. One mutation maps within the HLH domain, consistent with h function requiring homodimerization or heterodimerization with other HLH proteins. A second mutation lies in the basic domain, suggesting that DNA binding is required for h activity. Several mutations show that the h C terminus, in particular the WRPW domain, is also required for h activity, perhaps by interacting with other proteins to mediate transcriptional repression. We show that the h protein in Drosophila virilis closely resembles that in D. melanogaster and includes completely conserved bHLH and WRPW domains.},

abstract = {Interest in the problem of anteroposterior specification has quickened because of our near understanding of the mechanism in Drosophila and because of the homology of Antennapedia-like homeobox gene expression patterns in Drosophila and vertebrates. But vertebrates differ from Drosophila because of morphogenetic movements and interactions between tissue layers, both intimately associated with anteroposterior specification. The purpose of this article is to review classical findings and to enquire how far these have been confirmed, refuted or extended by modern work. The "pre-molecular" work suggests that there are several steps to the process: (i) Formation of anteroposterior pattern in mesoderm during gastrulation with posterior dominance. (ii) Regional specific induction of ectoderm to form neural plate. (iii) Reciprocal interactions from neural plate to mesoderm. (iv) Interactions within neural plate with posterior dominance. Unfortunately, almost all the observable markers are in the CNS rather than in the mesoderm where the initial specification is thought to occur. This has meant that the specification of the mesoderm has been assayed indirectly by transplantation methods such as the Einsteckung. New molecular markers now supplement morphological ones but they are still mainly in the CNS and not the mesoderm. A particular interest attaches to the genes of the Antp-like HOX clusters since these may not only be markers but actual coding factors for anteroposterior levels. We have a new understanding of mesoderm induction based on the discovery of activins and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) as candidate inducing factors. These factors have later consequences for anteroposterior pattern with activin tending to induce anterior, and FGF posterior structures. Recent work on neural induction has implicated cAMP and protein kinase C (PKC) as elements of the signal transduction pathway and has provided new evidence for the importance of tangential neural induction. The regional specificity of neural induction has been reinvestigated using molecular markers and provides conclusions rather similar to the classical work. Defects in the axial pattern may be produced by retinoic acid but it remains unclear whether its effects are truly coordinate ones or are concentrated in certain regions of high sensitivity. In general the molecular studies have supported and reinforced the "pre-molecular ones". Important questions still remain: (i) How much pattern is there in the mesoderm (how many states?) (ii) How is this pattern generated by the invaginating organizer? (iii) Is there one-to-one transmission of codings to the neural plate? (iv) What is the nature of the interactions within the neural plate? (v) Are the HOX cluster genes really the anteroposterior codings?},

We have named this gene Dromsopa for Drosophila male specific opa containing gene. The 0.6 kb mRNA for this gene is only found in the abdominal region of adult male Drosophila and in no other tissue or at other developmental stages. The Dromsopa opa repeat codes for the usual stretch of poly(glutamine) interrupted by histidine residues. The opa repetitive element was originally found in the Drosophila Notch gene (Kidd, S. et al. (1983) Cell 34, 431-433 and Wharton, K.A. (1985) Cell 40, 55-62) and has, more recently, been found in genes under developmental or tissue specific control from yeast to humans. The gene was cloned using a genomic fragment during a chromosomal walk upstream of the AP3 gene located at chromosomal location 79CD on the left arm of the third chromosome (Kelley, M.R. et al. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 965-973). The Dromsopa gene has no other identity with genes currently in the databases, once the opa repeat is excluded. The possibility that the Dromsopa gene is a male specific regulatory factor is under investigation as is its precise location within the abdomen, such as in germ line tissue. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

Genetic studies suggest that peak levels of dl protein in ventral regions of early embryos initiate twi expression. Using a combination of promoter fusion-P-transformation assays, and in vitro DNA-binding assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we establish a direct link between dl-binding sites and twi expression in the early embryo. We also present evidence that the dorsal-ventral limits of twi expression depend on the number and affinity of dl-binding sites present in its promoter.

There appear to be three major types of embryogenesis: Type 1, a general form characteristic of most invertebrate taxa of today, in which lineage plays an important role in the spatial organization of the early embryo, and cell specification occurs in situ, by both autonomous and conditional mechanisms; Type 2, the vertebrate form of embryogenesis, which proceeds by mechanisms that are essentially independent of cell lineage, in which diffusible morphogens and extensive early cell migration are particularly important; Type 3, the form exemplified by long germ band insects in which several different regulatory mechanisms are used to generate precise patterns of nuclear gene expression prior to cellularization. Evolutionary implications of the phylogenetic distribution of these types of embryogenesis are considered. Regionally expressed homeodomain regulators are utilized in all three types of embryo, in similar ways in later and postembryonic development, but in different ways in early embryonic development. A specific downstream molecular function for this class of regulator is proposed, based on evidence obtained in vertebrate systems. This provides a route by which to approach the comparative regulatory strategies underlying the three major types of embryogenesis.},

In parallel experiments, embryos can be treated with an antibody directed against the corresponding protein product to allow the detection of its distribution using standard immunochemical techniques. We have used this approach to compare the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the RNA and protein products of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) during the early stages of embryogenesis. This comparison revealed translational control of the maternally derived hb mRNA, which was difficult to detect by conventional techniques. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization method is as sensitive as conventional methods, but is faster and easier to perform. This may make it a useful tool for a variety of other systems.},

abstract = {A DNA binding and dimerization motif, with apparent amphipathic helices (the HLH motif), has recently been identified in various proteins, including two that bind to immunoglobulin enhancers (E12 and E47). We show here that various HLH proteins can bind as apparent heterodimers to a single DNA motif and also, albeit usually more weakly, as apparent homodimers. The HLH domain can mediate heterodimer formation between either daughterless, E12, or E47 (Class A) and achaete-scute T3 or MyoD (Class B) to form proteins with high affinity for the $\kappa$E2 site in the immunoglobulin kappa chain enhancer. The achaete-scute T3 and MyoD proteins do not form $\kappa$E2-binding heterodimers together, and no active complex with N-myc was evident. The formation of a heterodimer between the daughterless and achaete-scute T3 products may explain the similar phenotypes of mutants at these two loci and the genetic interactions between them. A role of E12 and E47 in mammalian development, analogous to that of daughterless in Drosophila, is likely. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Engrailed (en) is a gene involved in proper segmentation of the Drosophila embryo. The predicted en protein contains a homeodomain and regions rich in polyalanine, polyglutamine, polyglutamate/aspartate and serine. We have taken an evolu-tionary approach to define which regions may be of fun-damental importance by examining the D. virUis genomic sequence homologous to the D. melanogaster en primary transcription unit. Sequence homology begins at the first ATG of a long open reading frame yielding proteins of 584 and 552 amino acids for the D. virilis and D. melanogaster pro-teins, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence can be divided into conserved and non-conserved domains. The C-terminal 30{\%} of the protein (which includes the homeodo-main) is completely conserved. In the N-terminal 70{\%} of the protein, the overall conservation is 71{\%}, but non-conservative amino acid changes occur in clusters and there are short stret-ches of highly conserved sequence. A region rich in glutamate and aspartate is conserved and has homology to an 18-amino acid sequence present in members of the myc family of pro-teins. Major differences in the size of the two proteins occur in regions of non-conserved repeated sequences. In the in-trons of the engrailed transcription units there are long stret-ches of conservation, suggesting this DNA may be of functional importance. Key words: developmental gene/DNA sequence conservation/ Drosophilalengrailed gene/myc gene dicates functional importance (Wilson et al., 1977), the homeo-domain must play a crucial role within the proteins which contain it. Recent evidence suggests that at least one function en-coded by this domain is sequence-specific DNA binding (Laughon and Scott, 1984; McGinnis et al., 1984a; Desplan et al., 1985; and in preparation). Besides the homeodomain, the protein-coding regions of many developmental genes share another feature, regions rich in a single amino acid (Laughon et al., 1985). These are predominantly en-coded by trinucleotide repeats. The most prevalent of these is a CAX repeat (alternatively called a strep, opa or M repeat; Kidd et al., 1983; Wharton et al., 1985b; McGinnis et al., 1984a) which codes for polyglutamine (Laughon et al., 1985). Several repeat regions can occur in a single protein. For example, the predicted engrailed protein contains various regions rich in glut-amine, alanine, serine and acidic amino acids (Poole et al., 1985). The function of these regions is unclear, but their presence in so many of the developmentally important genes of Drosophila may mean that they serve some functional or structural role in the proteins which contain them. An example of such a gene is the Drosophila segmentation gene, engrailed (en). En is required for development of the posterior part of each segment and for the maintenance of seg-ment and compartment borders (Lawrence and Morata, 1976; Kornberg, 198 1a, 198 1b; Lawrence and Struhl, 1982). It is ex-pressed early in development in a striped pattern where the ex-pressing regions are the progenitors of the posterior part of each segment (Kornberg et al., 1985; Fjose et al., 1985; DiNardo et al., 1985; Weir and Kornberg, 1985; Ingham et al., 1985).

Loss of Antp function results in altered development of the embryonic thoracic segments or can cause legs to be transformed into antennae.

The structure of the Antp gene, analyzed by sequencing cDNA clones and exons and by transcript mapping, revealed some of the basis for its genetic complexity. It has two promoters governing two nested transcription units, one unit 36 and one 103 kilobase pairs (kb) long. Both units incorporated the same protein-coding exons, all of which are located in the 3'-most 13 kb of the gene. The two promoters resulted in the attachment of either of two long noncoding leader sequences (1.5 and 1.7 kb) to a 1.1-kb open reading frame. Both transcription units used the same pair of alternative polyadenylation sites 1.4 kb apart; the choice of sites was developmentally regulated. Some of the mutations that disrupt the larger transcription unit complemented a mutation affecting the smaller one. Dominant mutations that transform antennae into legs split the gene but left the coding exons intact. The encoded protein has unusually long runs of glutamine and a homeodomain near the C terminus.},

The major Notch transcript encodes a protein of 2,703 amino acids. The protein is probably associated with cell surfaces and carries an extracellular domain composed of 36 cysteine-rich repeating units, each of about 38 amino acids. The gene appears to have evolved by repeated tandem duplications of the DNA coding for the 38-amino-acid-long protein segments, followed by insertion of intervening sequences. These repeating protein segments are quite homologous to portions of mammalian clotting factors IX and X and to the product of the Caenorhabditis elegans developmental gene lin-12.

In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},
